### Data Structures

1. **Data Structures I (AEDS1):**  
   An introductory course covering programming fundamentals and algorithm development. Topics include data types, control structures, loops, recursion, file handling, arrays, pointers, and development environment setup (MinGW, VS Code).

2. **Data Structures II (AEDS2):**  
   Explores advanced programming and algorithmic analysis. Topics include complexity theory, sorting algorithms, linear and flexible data structures (queues, stacks, linked lists), binary trees, balancing techniques (AVL, 2-3-4 trees), hash tables, and TRIE trees.

3. **Data Structures III (AEDS3):**  
   Focuses on secondary memory, data storage, and advanced topics like file structures, external sorting, B-trees, compression techniques, cryptography (DES, AES), digital trees, and pattern matching algorithms (KMP, Boyer-Moore, Aho-Corasick).
