# Data structure I,II and III from Puc Minas University.

## Overview:

**Data Structure I (aeds1):**


Algorithms and Data Structures 1 (AEDS1) is a comprehensive introductory course covering fundamental concepts in programming and algorithm development. The course encompasses a wide range of topics, including the history of computers, algorithm development methodologies, basic data types and variables, console input and output, operators and expressions, conditional structures, loops, modularization, parameter passing, recursion, pointers, file handling, arrays, matrices, and character manipulation. Additionally, students learn to set up a development environment using MinGW and Visual Studio Code. This course equips students with essential skills to create efficient algorithms, solve programming problems, and develop high-quality software.

**Data Structure II (aeds2)**


Algorithms and Data Structures 2 (AEDS2) is a course that delves into advanced topics in programming and algorithmic analysis. The curriculum covers a range of subjects, including introductory concepts such as complexity theory, internal sorting algorithms like selection sort, summations, fundamentals of algorithm analysis, linear data structures, sorting algorithms (insertion, merge, quicksort, heap), partial sorting, flexible data structures (references, allocation, head cells, stacks, queues, lists, double-linked lists, matrices, garbage collection), binary trees (basic concepts, node insertion and traversal, exercises, removal, insertion in C and C++, hybrid structures), balancing techniques (rotation types, AVL trees, 2-3-4 trees, bicolor trees), hash tables, dictionaries, and TRIE trees. The course culminates in two examinations to assess student comprehension and mastery of the covered material.

**Data Structure III (aeds3)**


Algorithms and Data Structures 3 (AEDS3) is an advanced course that delves into various aspects of computer science, with a focus on secondary memory and data storage. The curriculum covers a wide array of topics, including the structure of hard drives and SSDs, the timing of operations, file handling and input/output streams, treating files as byte vectors, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, structured data files, file types, sequential files, external sorting, balanced merging, variable-length segments, replacement selection, indexed files, B-trees, B+ trees, Extensible Hash Tables, inverted lists, compression techniques (Elias Gamma, Entropy, Huffman, Run-Length Encoding, Shannon-Fano, Dictionaries, LZ77, LZ78, LZW), cryptography (substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, stream ciphers, block ciphers, DES, 3DES, TDES, AES), digital search review, digital trees (Trie, Binary Digital Tree, Prefix Tree, PATRICIA Tree), pattern matching (brute force, KMP, Shift-And, Boyer-Moore, Aho-Corasick), and approximate pattern matching.
